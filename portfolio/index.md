Hello! I'm currently a masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology conducting research on MEMS based ultrasound sensors for wireless power transfer applications. That image on the left is an example of what I work with: arrays of micromachined membranes suspended over vacuum cavities. Each membrane is the width of a human hair! Feel free to look around at some of the projects I've worked on both in and out of school.
