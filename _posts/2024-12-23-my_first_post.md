So it's Christmas Eve Eve and I'm spending my evening writing my first blog post, wondering if Christmas Eve Eve should be hyphenated or capitalized. Here's the story of how and why I'm starting this blog.

I recently watched Joe's (of BPS.space) [rant on personal engineering projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jgTCayWlwc){:target="_blank"} about the most important objective of any personal project: finishing the damn thing. The project I was trying to finish was porting my professional portfolio from it's previous home on Wix.com to one I had total control over, which landed me on the Jekyll static site generator hosted on Github Pages. But Jekyll has a built-in blogging feature, and the theme I picked had a nice big "Blog" header at the top. As you can see, here I was starting another side quest before completing the main one. 

I think I can make myself an exception for this one though, because I'm considering this side quest finished at the time this site goes live. Subsequent blog *posts* can be started and finished within a given time frame, but the blog *itself* cannot; that would be a book. So what I've really done is created and finished a new project, while at the same time documenting my portfolio-porting project which incentivizes me to finish that  ... soon ... er. 

What will the ensuing blog posts contain? There may be some engineering. Likely more mechanical in nature given my background, but will hopefully branch into other fields. There may be some music related post, including, but not limited to Russian Romantic period piano repitoire. It may be random thoughts I have on my daily commute, if I can remember them by the time I arrive. Or it may be none at all, wherein my first blog post becomes my last blog post as well. Schr√∂dinger's post. Whatever is the case, blog(s) will be tagged appropriately for efficient sorting if it comes down to that.

Thank you for reading.
