This second post serves little purpose. I really just wanted to get a post out in 2025 so I can say *n* years from now that I ran a blog continuously for *(n+2)* years instead of *n* years.

Anyways, since I had to refamiliarize myself with git and Jekyll, I might as well keep the momentum going and not let that go to waste. It may be second nature to web developers and software engineers, but it's not a workflow I employ frequently.

What to write about. What about a discusison about the role of generative AI in general blogging, post 2022? I could dedicate an entire post on my thoughts regarding this topic, but let's just summarize *how* I intend to use it for this blog without delving into the *why*.

How I might use gen AI
- As a proofreader for grammar and punctuation on a first draft. I might not even pursue this.
- For technical help with Jekyll's back-end structure. Tell me *how* to make the site look the way *I* want, not *how* the site *should* look.

How I will not use gen AI
- Generating content (e.g. text, images, audio) from prompts. Ironic, but I just don't think I can consider that as a personal blog anymore.

Well, my self-imposed deadline of the new year is coming up, so I'll leave it at that for now. Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! (This is statistically unlikely to be relevant at the time you're reading this post).
